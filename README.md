# (Frontend) Employee Manager App

## Project Description
The Angular (JavaScript) frontend of Full Stack employee manager app with a Spring Boot (Java) backend.

Angular 14.2.9 was used so as to learn its basic syntax and semantics.

A challenge came about with formatting the employees full names so that they would not be put on separate lines. The solution of changing the styling from the bootstrap default styling will helpful in the future when trying to make responsive designs.

## Installation

   ### Development server

    Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

   ### Code scaffolding

    Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

   ### Build

    Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

   ### Running unit tests

    Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

   ### Running end-to-end tests
